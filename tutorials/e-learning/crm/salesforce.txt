Salesforce
----------

Cloud computing - use of remote servers to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or personal computer

Vendor delivers software app on the cloud
Client accesses software app via the cloud

Salesforce is a cloud computing platform that provide service as SaaS (software product) and PaaS (build your own product)

Benefits of cloud computing
---------------------------
1. cheap
2. scalable
3. supports team collaborations (Decentralized, not setup on local computer, accessible over internet)
4. hassle-free

Multi-tenant Architecture of Salesforce
---------------------------------------
1. One instance shared by multiple tenants
2. Economical; resources and maintenance cost is shared (by all the tenants)
3. Vendor needs to update only application and changes will be reflected for all clients
4. Single database stores data of multiple clients
5. Sharing rules enforce by Governor limits (client 2 will not get client 1's data)

Metadata Architecture of Salesforce
-----------------------------------
1. Salesforce uses a metadata-driven development model (Tenant-specific metadata, Common metabase, Data)
2. Functionalities of an app are defined as metadata in a database
3. Allows developers to concentrate only on building the application
4. Includes processes, assignment rules, sharing & security settings, Visualforce pages & Apex triggers
5. Stores page layouts for: Accounts, Contacts, Leads

Salesforce products & services
------------------------------
1. Sales
2. Marketing
3. Service
4. Analytics
5. Community
6. App
7. Commerce
8. IoT
9. Health

Salesforce Certification Roadmap
--------------------------------
1. Developer track
Platform App Builder (touch and play) -> Technical Architect
Platform Developer I (code on Apex)-> Platform Developer II
2. Administrator/Implementation track

---------
Campaigns
Leads
Accounts
Contacts
Opportunities (Hot leads/close to become customers)
Forecasts
Contracts
Orders
Cases
Solutions
Products
Reports
Dashboards

Building blocks of Salesforce Apps
----------------------------------
1. Tabs - access objects (tables) in Salesforce App. Display list of records stored in an object
2. Profiles - collection of settings and permissions which controls what a user can view, access and modify in Salesforce
(Based on roles or groups)
3. Objects - database tables where data is present
4. Fields - Individual data points of an object
5. Records - collection of fields with values for fields and represent an instance of an object

Features
--------

1. Customize fields to view in object
Available Fields - all fields on left pane
(add/remove button between left and right pane)
Selected Fields - required fields on right pane
(up/down button to choose order)

2. Custom App
Select tabs from pre-defined list
Available objects/Selected objects/Default landing object

3. Create object
name, label
field name, label, data type
optional features - allow reports, allow activities, track field history, allow in chat groups
object classification - allow sharing, allow bulk api access, allow streaming api access
deployment status - In development, deployed

4. Custom object tab
label, name, style, color
profiles
apps

5. Custom fields and relationships
Data type
field label, name, length, required (mandatory), unique, default value
Visibility - only me, all users or users in group

6. Field dependencies - controlling field and dependent field
Include and exclude values for each controlling field from overall list of dependent fields
i. Master-Details relationship - parent & child relationship - child looks up parent object
child requires parent object
child inherits parent properties/settings
if parent is deleted, child is also deleted (cascade delete)
ii. Lookup relationship - parent & child relationship (one to many)
child does not require parent object
child does not inherit parent settings
if parent is deleted, child is not deleted (no cascade delete)

7. Page layout (for objects)
create sections (one/two column section for left & right)
customize section name
tab-key order

8. Validation rules
i. Rule name, active, error condition formula (fields, operators & functions) error message
functions - isBlank, isNull, length, includes, or, and, logical etc.
ii. formula fields - calculates 3rd field based on formula on 2 fields

Users, Profiles, Permission sets and Roles
------------------------------------------
users have profiles
profiles are like teams or groups
profiles have defined permissions sets
profiles have access to only certain objects, fields etc.
access can be read, create, edit, delete for basic or view all, modify all for data administration access
permission sets extends functionality of profiles (to give few more permissions)
permissions sets are user level access to objects, fields etc.
roles (view/edit data within or outside profile)

hierarchy - P parent of A and B, then P can access A and B's data
A cannot access P & B's data
B cannot access P & A's data
M parent of P can access P, A and B's data

Workflows
---------
When action occurs on an object, then execute workflow
i. Workflow rules
Evaluation criteria - created, created & every time it's edited, created & edited when it meets edit rule criteria
Edit rule criteria - set field, operator, value
2. Workflow action
New email alert, New Field update, New outbound message, Select existing action

Data Management Techniques
--------------------------
1. Data importing
<50k records
Add data in CSV file. Select custom object to import into.
Select action - create new, update existing, create new and update existing records
Edit CSV columns to Object fields mapping
Summary of Data import (number of rows, columns etc.) and then Start import
2. Data loading
>50k records
