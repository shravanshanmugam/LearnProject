networking

moving information from one device to another device

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
1. Physical Layer - Cables (Twisted pair, CoAx, Fibre optics)
2. Data Link Layer - Protocols (Ethernet, DOCSIS-3 used by ISP) used to send information between network segments (computer-router, router-ISP, ISP-internet, internet-Servers)
3. Network Layer - IP Addressing & IP Routing allows us to send information from one unique address to another unique address
4. Transport Layer - Create connection/session between client and server using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) before we start sending information. It provides services such as connection-oriented communication, reliability, flow control, and multiplexing.
5. Session Layer - In case of a connection loss this protocol may try to recover the connection. If a connection is not used for a long period, the session-layer protocol may close it and re-open it. It provides for either full duplex or half-duplex operation and provides synchronization points in the stream of exchanged messages.
6. Presentation Layer - Protocols to translating text between different encoding like ASCII and EBCDIC
7. Application Layer - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is formatting to send information from server to client and how to present that information in a web browser

Application Layer Protocols
1. Data Transfer Protocols
Transferring data as hyper text document using HTTP or HTTPS (secure)
HTTPS protocol encrypts data that is being transferred
Transport Layer component called port number uniquely identifies the Application Layer protocol being used
HTTP - 80
HTTPS - 443
File transfer using FTP, sFTP (secure), TFTP (trivial)
FTP, sFTP requires authentication
FTP - 20 21
sFTP - 22 (use this protocol inside of an SSH session which allows us to encrypt the traffic)
TFTP - 69
SMB (Server Message Block) - 445
FileZilla is an FTP client to connect to and FTP server to transfer files
Email transfer using POP3, IMAP used by client to retrieve email from a server
SMTP takes a message that you create on a client email application and use it to send that email to an SMTP server which then forwards to recipient
POP3 (Post Office Protocol) - 110/995
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) - 143/993
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - 25/465
It can work in both unencrypted or encrypted modes depending on which port is used (unencrypted/encrypted)
2. Authentication Protocols
LDAP/LDAPs (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to authenticate user to a network and bring down mapped network drives and setting to user's work station
LDAP Server provides token when authenticated successfully which will be used for accessing resources
LDAP - 389
LDAPs - 636
3. Network Service Protocols
Transfer data i.e. little bits of information to allow network to work properly
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server  hands out IP addresses to any device that is connected dynamically
Client (device) sends message to DHCP server requesting an IP Address
DHCP server sends IP Address, Subnet mask, Default gateway, DNS Server and other information to client
Without DHCP we would have to do manual configuration when our device moves from network to network
Domain Name System (DNS) maps domain names to IP Addresses which can be used to communicate with a server
nslookup command is used to get public IP Address of websites
Macs-MacBook-Pro:~ mac$ nslookup google.com
Server:		192.168.1.1
Address:	192.168.1.1#53
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	google.com
Address: 172.217.163.110
Network Time Protocol (NTP) to automatically configure all the times on our clients to be the same
Coordinated Universal Time is used to accommodate for Time zones
4. Network Management Protocols
Telnet - 33
SSH (Secure Shell) - 22
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) server to collect information about SNMP clients
It can walk the tree, like get status of ports, interface is up or down, processor utilization, temperature of device, log messages or issues
If client is in trouble it can send out an SNMP Trap to SNMP Server which can then send out an alert to network administrator
RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to get access to desktop of a server and remotely manage that device
RDP - 3389
5. Audio/Visual Protocols
H.323 - 1720/1721
SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) - 5060/5061 used by VoIP
Typically used in video conferencing

Transport Layer Protocols
1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
3-way handshake to establish session between client and server
i. SYN (synchronize) message from client to server
ii. SYN-ACK message from server to client
iii. ACK from client to server
Once session is established, application layer protocol like HTTP can be used to transfer data
4-way disconnect for graceful session disconnection
i. FIN message to finish (either client or server can initiate)
ii. FIN-ACK message
iii. FIN message
iv. FIN-ACK message
Session is closed, cannot send anymore information
TCP Reset to quickly end a session (abruptly)
2. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
client requests data to server
server responds with data
No 3-way handshake
No reliable communication
No sequence numbers, no acknowledge numbers (to verify whether data sent was received)
No connection or session established
Used for efficient data transfer
DNS Server can use UDP protocol

Transport Layer Addressing
1. We are using port numbers to identify application layer protocols that are being used
2. Source and destination port numbers
i. Server port numbers
well known (0-1023)
used as destination port numbers
HTTP-80, HTTPS-443, SSH-22, TELNET-23, FTP-20/21
registered (1024-49151)
used for custom applications both official and unofficial port numbers
ii. Client port numbers
Ephemeral (temporary) (49152-65535)

IP Addressing
1. 32-bit Address used in network layer to move information from one device to another device on the internet
2. Classless addressing
Subnet mask determines network portion and host portion
Subnet mask determined by setting network portion to 1s and host portion to 0s
Network portion is common to all devices in a network
Host portion is specific to a device in the network
203.0.113.10, 24-bit network portion, 8-bit host portion
Subnet mask 255.255.255.0
10.0.0.10, 24-bit network portion, 8-bit host portion
Subnet mask 255.0.0.0
10.0.0.10, 20-bit network portion, 12-bit host portion
Subnet mask 255.255.240.0
3. Classful addressing
Class IP Range
A   0.0.0.0   127.255.255.255
B   128.0.0.0 191.255.255.255
C   192.0.0.0 223.255.255.255
D   224.0.0.0 239.255.255.255
E   240.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
Class A, B, C are unicast addresses. Only these are usable on public internet
Unicast communication is when one single device is talking to another device
Class D are multicast addresses. Not supported on public internet. Supported within enterprise organisations
Multicast communication is one device communicating to multiple devices
Example live video streaming of meeting within enterprise

Class A addresses, 8-bit network portion, 24-bit host portion
Class B addresses, 16-bit network portion, 16-bit host portion
Class C addresses, 24-bit network portion, 8-bit host portion
Class D addresses, 32-bit network portion
Class E addresses considered experimental address range and not used
4. Address Types
Network address a.k.a. Network prefix - identifier for a group of devices. It is like a zip code to identify an area of addresses
It has all binary 0s in the host portion of the IP address
Broadcast address - identifier for all devices on a network. It is an address that can send a message to all the devices at once
It has all binary 1s in the host portion of the IP address
Host address - identifier for unique device on a network
It is everything in host portion of the IP address except all binarys 0s and all binary 1s i.e except network address and broadcast address
5. CIDR (Classless Inter Domain Routing) Notation
IP Address: 203.0.213.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
CIDR Notation: 203.0.213.10/24 (24-bit network portion)
ip address/n - n length of network portion
6. Private IP Address not routable on public internet
Private IP Address range
10.0.0.0/8 10.255.255.255/8
172.16.0.0/12 172.31.255.255/12
192.168.0.0/16 192.168.255.255/16
APIPA address 169.254.0.0/16
Loopback address 127.0.0.1 to check if TCP/IP is working on local system
