networking

moving information from one device to another device

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
1. Physical Layer - Cables (Twisted pair, CoAx, Fibre optics)
2. Data Link Layer - Protocols (Ethernet, DOCSIS-3 used by ISP) used to send information between network segments (computer-router, router-ISP, ISP-internet, internet-Servers)
3. Network Layer - IP Addressing & IP Routing allows us to send information from one unique address to another unique address
4. Transport Layer - Create connection/session between client and server using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) before we start sending information. It provides services such as connection-oriented communication, reliability, flow control, and multiplexing.
5. Session Layer - In case of a connection loss this protocol may try to recover the connection. If a connection is not used for a long period, the session-layer protocol may close it and re-open it. It provides for either full duplex or half-duplex operation and provides synchronization points in the stream of exchanged messages.
6. Presentation Layer - Protocols to translating text between different encoding like ASCII and EBCDIC
7. Application Layer - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is formatting to send information from server to client and how to present that information in a web browser

Application Layer Protocols
1. Data Transfer Protocols
Transferring data as hyper text document using HTTP or HTTPS (secure)
HTTPS protocol encrypts data that is being transferred
Transport Layer component called port number uniquely identifies the Application Layer protocol being used
HTTP - 80
HTTPS - 443
File transfer using FTP, sFTP (secure), TFTP (trivial)
FTP, sFTP requires authentication
FTP - 20 21
sFTP - 22 (use this protocol inside of an SSH session which allows us to encrypt the traffic)
TFTP - 69
SMB (Server Message Block) - 445
FileZilla is an FTP client to connect to and FTP server to transfer files
Email transfer using POP3, IMAP used by client to retrieve email from a server
SMTP takes a message that you create on a client email application and use it to send that email to an SMTP server which then forwards to recipient
POP3 (Post Office Protocol) - 110/995
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) - 143/993
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - 25/465
It can work in both unencrypted or encrypted modes depending on which port is used (unencrypted/encrypted)
2. Authentication Protocols
LDAP/LDAPs (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to authenticate user to a network and bring down mapped network drives and setting to user's work station
LDAP Server provides token when authenticated successfully which will be used for accessing resources
LDAP - 389
LDAPs - 636
3. Network Service Protocols
Transfer data i.e. little bits of information to allow network to work properly
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server  hands out IP addresses to any device that is connected dynamically
Client (device) sends message to DHCP server requesting an IP Address
DHCP server sends IP Address, Subnet mask, Default gateway, DNS Server and other information to client
Without DHCP we would have to do manual configuration when our device moves from network to network
Domain Name System (DNS) maps domain names to IP Addresses which can be used to communicate with a server
nslookup command is used to get public IP Address of websites
Macs-MacBook-Pro:~ mac$ nslookup google.com
Server:		192.168.1.1
Address:	192.168.1.1#53
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	google.com
Address: 172.217.163.110
Network Time Protocol (NTP) to automatically configure all the times on our clients to be the same
Coordinated Universal Time is used to accommodate for Time zones
4. Network Management Protocols
Telnet - 33
SSH (Secure Shell) - 22
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) server to collect information about SNMP clients
It can walk the tree, like get status of ports, interface is up or down, processor utilization, temperature of device, log messages or issues
If client is in trouble it can send out an SNMP Trap to SNMP Server which can then send out an alert to network administrator
RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to get access to desktop of a server and remotely manage that device
RDP - 3389
5. Audio/Visual Protocols
H.323 - 1720/1721
SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) - 5060/5061 used by VoIP
Typically used in video conferencing

Transport Layer Protocols
1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
3-way handshake to establish session between client and server
i. SYN (synchronize) message from client to server
ii. SYN-ACK message from server to client
iii. ACK from client to server
Once session is established, application layer protocol like HTTP can be used to transfer data
4-way disconnect for graceful session disconnection
i. FIN message to finish (either client or server can initiate)
ii. FIN-ACK message
iii. FIN message
iv. FIN-ACK message
Session is closed, cannot send anymore information
TCP Reset to quickly end a session (abruptly)
2. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
client requests data to server
server responds with data
No 3-way handshake
No reliable communication
No sequence numbers, no acknowledge numbers (to verify whether data sent was received)
No connection or session established
Used for efficient data transfer
DNS Server can use UDP protocol

Transport Layer Addressing
1. We are using port numbers to identify application layer protocols that are being used
2. Source and destination port numbers
i. Server port numbers
well known (0-1023)
used as destination port numbers
HTTP-80, HTTPS-443, SSH-22, TELNET-23, FTP-20/21
registered (1024-49151)
used for custom applications both official and unofficial port numbers
ii. Client port numbers
Ephemeral (temporary) (49152-65535)

IP Addressing
1. 32-bit Address used in network layer to move information from one device to another device on the internet
2. Classless addressing
Subnet mask determines network portion and host portion
Subnet mask determined by setting network portion to 1s and host portion to 0s
Network portion is common to all devices in a network
Host portion is specific to a device in the network
203.0.113.10, 24-bit network portion, 8-bit host portion
Subnet mask 255.255.255.0
10.0.0.10, 24-bit network portion, 8-bit host portion
Subnet mask 255.0.0.0
10.0.0.10, 20-bit network portion, 12-bit host portion
Subnet mask 255.255.240.0
3. Classful addressing

D   224.0.0.0 239.255.255.255
E   240.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
Class A, B, C are unicast addresses. Only these are usable on public internet
Unicast communication is when one single device is talking to another device
Class D are multicast addresses. Not supported on public internet. Supported within enterprise organisations
Multicast communication is one device communicating to multiple devices
Example live video streaming of meeting within enterprise

Class A addresses, 8-bit network portion, 24-bit host portion
Class B addresses, 16-bit network portion, 16-bit host portion
Class C addresses, 24-bit network portion, 8-bit host portion
Class D addresses, 32-bit network portion
Class E addresses considered experimental address range and not used
4. Address Types
Network address a.k.a. Network prefix - identifier for a group of devices. It is like a zip code to identify an area of addresses
It has all binary 0s in the host portion of the IP address
Broadcast address - identifier for all devices on a network. It is an address that can send a message to all the devices at once
It has all binary 1s in the host portion of the IP address
Host address - identifier for unique device on a network
It is everything in host portion of the IP address except all binarys 0s and all binary 1s i.e except network address and broadcast address
5. CIDR (Classless Inter Domain Routing) Notation
IP Address: 203.0.213.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
CIDR Notation: 203.0.213.10/24 (24-bit network portion)
ip address/n - n length of network portion
6. Private IP Address not routable on public internet
Private IP Address range
10.0.0.0/8 10.255.255.255/8
172.16.0.0/12 172.31.255.255/12
192.168.0.0/16 192.168.255.255/16
APIPA address 169.254.0.0/16
Loopback address 127.0.0.1 to check if TCP/IP is working on local system

Subnetting Networks
1. Breaking networks into smaller networks
Network address: 10.0.0.0
Subnet mask: 10.255.255.255 (also broadcast address)
CIDR Notation: 10.0.0.0/8
Host address will be in the range 10.0.0.0.and 10.255.255.255
Take host address: 10.0.10.0
Take subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
CIDR Notation: 10.0.10.0/24
Network address will be: 10.0.10.0
Broadcast address: 10.0.10.255
Host address will be in the range 10.0.10.0 and 10.0.10.255
This is a small section of the bigger network
We can have lot of such network addresses with 24-bit network portion
We can also have different subnets with different network portion length such that the IP addresses don't overlap
Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)
Network address: 10.0.0.0/8

IPv6 Addresses
1. Size
Bit - 1 bit (0 or 1)
Nibble - 4 bits
Byte - 8 bits
Hextet - 16 bits
2. IPv6 addresses are 128-bits long = 32 nibbles = 8 hextets
3. Network portion and Interface Identifier (host) portion typically at 64 bits
2001:0DB8:0002:008D:0000:0000:00A5:52F5/64
4. Shortening IPv6 address
eliminate leading 0s
2001:DB8:2:8D:0:0:A5:52F5/64
eliminate 0s with double colon
2001:DB8:2:8D::A5:52F5
we can use only one double colon
5. How many IPv6 addresses?
2^64 - 18 billion billion bits for single IPv6 network with 64-bit network portion
6. Dual stack - both IPv4 and IPv6 address running on a machine
IPv6 address has a link-local address that exists only within layer 2 (link layer) network
6. Acquiring IPv6 address
i. SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto Configuration)
Windows device gets IPv6 address of router and picks its own IPv6 address by picking random 64 bit interface identifier value
ii. Unix/Linux/Mac device uses modified EUI - 64
Take MAC address which is 48 bits long, break them in half and in the middle put FF:FE
Mac address: 000C:29FC:70A5
Interface identifier portion of IPv6 address: 000C:29FF:FEFC:70A5
Take first 8 bits, flip the 7th bit
New interface identifier portion of IPv6 address: 020C:29FF:FEFC:70A5
iii. IPv6 DHCP Server works similar to IPv4 DHCP Server
7. Tunneling IPv6
Hurricane Electric IPv6 internet

Ethernet
1. Layer 2 protocol
2 types
Wireless ethernet
Wired ethernet
2. CSMA/CD
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection for Ethernet operation
When a computer wants to send a message over a network it would send an electric pulse of +5 or -5 volts or no voltage on the wire
On/off of 5 volts or no 5 volts creates a signal to allow us to transfer a message by creating a pulse of 1s and 0s
All devices on network will receive the message but only the intended recipient will respond
Multiple access here means that all devices are sharing the same wire
When one device is transferring a message, another device that want to send data will have to wait till first device is done
It is possible when two devices are hearing over the network, that they can find no devices communicating and end up sending electric pulse
All devices are designed to recognise signals which are beyond 5 volts which implies collision when there is a surge of voltage
The network stops communication waits for random period of time, start listening to the wire and start communicating again
Collision Domain is a group of network devices that will simultaneously detect a voltage spike
Voltage spike is multiple devices sending data at the same time
3. Duplex and Speed
Duplex on ethernet connection can be half or full
Half duplex connection means one device communicates at a time. Other device waits. They cannot send data to each other simultaneously. Example: Talkie talkie
Full duplex connection means two devices can communicate at the same time. Example: Telephone
Collisions are not possible in full duplex communication because both devices can send data on the wire at the same time
Modern Collision Domain is going to be on a half duplex connection between a PC and a switch
This could be because it's an old device, an old switch or old wiring
Most modern network are full duplex meaning PC and switch can send data both simultaneously
Ethernet name       Speed
Ethernet            10 Mbps
FastEthernet        100 Mbps
GigabitEthernet     1 Gbps
10GigabitEthernet   10 Gbps (used to connect different ISPs together)
40GigabitEthernet   40 Gbps (used in data centers and connections in the WAN connections that allow ISPs to communicate with each other)
GigabitEthernet, 10GigabitEthernet and 40GigabitEthernet requires full duplex so CSMA/CD doesn't apply
4. Ethernet Frame is mechanism used to move data across an ethernet network from one device to another
Frame is a chunk of data with a data link layer header
Destination Mac Address 48 bits
Source Mac Address      48 bits
Type                    16 bits
Data (packet)           1500 bytes (max)
FCS                     32 bits
Everything except Data are part of Ethernet header
Data can be layer 2 or layer 3 information
MAC Address are layer 2 identifiers that are specifically tied to a network interface card
Network Interface Card is the device we plug in our Ethernet cable into meaning Ethernet cable is plugged into NIC
MAC Address consists of Manufacture ID (first 24 bits) and Serial Number (last 24 bits) it is a hardware address that is assigned to the devices right at the factory
Type field tells what type of data is being transferred like layer 2 or layer 3 data
FCS is Frame Check Sequence which does Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) taking in all information in a frame and computes a value which is put into a 32-bit field at the end of the frame called the FCS
The device receiving the ethernet frame computes the FCS and checks if it is the same as the FCS of the sent frame
Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is the maximum amount of data that we can transfer in an Ethernet frame
Protocol Data Unit (PDU) varies from layer to layer on the OSI model is the entire frame and the data we're transferring
5. Network Topologies
i. Bus topology
there is a single wire which we tap into and run our devices off of that
ii. Ring topology (token ring)
Token that would spin around a ring. As devices needed to transmit data, they would attach messages to this token.
As a device would receive the token with a message for it, it would take the message off the token put it back on the wire and the process would start over again
iii. Star topology (used by modern ethernet)
Worked using a hub (multi port repeater). Put a signal into it and all other devices on the network can hear it. If two devices put a signal simultaneously there would be a collision
Switches break up collision domains. Switches keep track of MAC addresses using Port to Mac Address table. They read frame headers and see which source Mac address is being received by a port
When message is sent from port 1 to port 2 it creates a virtual circuit connection between the two devices through the port.
None of the other devices can hear that message. This allows communication between only source and destination MAC addresses
6. Broadcast messages
Destination MAC Address = FFFF FFFF FFFF
This is a layer 2 broadcast address
The frame is sent to all active interfaces except the receiving interface
Broadcast domain is a group of networked devices which will receive a layer 2 broadcast message
